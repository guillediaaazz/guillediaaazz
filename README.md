- 👋 Hi, I’m @guillediaaazz
- 🎧 I’m interested in DIY projects (particularly electronics for modular synthesizers) and other audio applications
- 🎵 like synthesis or DSP in vsts, music production, mixing, analog audio equipment
- 🌱 I’m currently studying physics but I love to keep learning about many other disciplines.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different electronics projects, maybe projects which require that pyshics knowledge.
- 📫 It's possible to reach me via email: guillediazmata@gmail.com
