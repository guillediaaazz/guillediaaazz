- 👋 Hi, I’m @guillediaaazz
- 👀 I’m interested in arduino, DIY projects, electronics, robotics, and videogames such as Kerbal Space Program
- 🌱 I’m currently studying physics but I want to learn about programming so I'm starting on this
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on different arduino projects, maybe projects which require that pyshics knowledge because I'm not really a programmer
- 📫 It's possible to reach me via email: guillediazmata@gmail.com
